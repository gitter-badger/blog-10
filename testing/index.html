            Testing seems to be something of a contentious subject as of late
            and the amount of people who argue about it just baffles me
        </h5>
        <h5>
            Testing is essential to good software development
            I hope everyone can agree on this point
        </h5>
        <h5>
            For those who can't, here are my opinions on testing and
            maybe by the end you will agree that you are wrong.
            But for those who agree keep reading, as this is ammunition
            against those who would otherwise disagree.
