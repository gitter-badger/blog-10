            <h1>About Luke Preston</h1>
            <pre>Software Developer
I will have been working for the BBC for 2 years come April
During the time I have worked on iPlayer on TV
It primarily uses JavaScript, HTML and CSS

Before that I trained at FDM as a Java Developer
Then attained a 2 year contract at UBS

I have been described as a hipster developer
Mostly because I am MAD about learning anything NEW
As such I am now a proficient GO developer

Before I was a developer I studied Mathematics and Keele University
It was an amazing degree where I specialized in pure mathematics

I am married to Melanie Preston, a dance teacher and choreographer
And I have a daughter who was born 21st Oct 2015 (back to the future anyone!)

            <h2>About The Blogs</h2>
            <pre>This blog is dedicated to the things I have learned
Everything is entirely my own opinion
Most likely written in a one sided argument where I always win

I also want to put forward ideas and thoughts about coding
I wouldn't mind doing some maths again but I doubt I will have time

I am a huge advocate of testing, in particular test driven development
Always being/doing Agile and have never tried anything else

The contents below, if it is blue then I have written something
If it is not blue then it is because I want to do something or it is a draft
